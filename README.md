# Advanced Synchrony Overview

## Looking Back

- Recap earlier async material
  - fetch() “chant”
    - Repeat the fetch/then/then chant
    - Remind what’s happening in terms of what’s being returned in each phase of the fetch/then/then (promise, promise, whatever they decide)
  - We don’t expect you to know Promise, but that’s what we’re going to explore in this thing

## Looking Ahead

- And set up following material
  - You must understand asynchronous eventing
  - You must learn the Promise API
